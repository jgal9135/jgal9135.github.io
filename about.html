    <font size="4" color="black" style="font-family:New Century Schoolbook, serif">The Gal is also known as Julia Gallaway. She is a seventeen year old girl and will be a senior at Bishop O'Dowd High School this upcoming 2017-2018 school year. She is beginning to apply for college and continues to research schools all across the nation. Julia enjoys many activities such as volunteering, playing sports, gardening, and of course, cooking! She began cooking when she was little, standing on her stool, adding ingredients while her mother watches over and teaches Julia how to make the perfect dish. Julia owes her cooking career to her mother especially, along with her father, grandmothers, and aunts.</font></div>

  <font size="4" color="black" style="font-family:New Century Schoolbook, serif">Julia had lots of fun creating this website! She is ecstatic about being able to choose the topic based on something that she truly loves: cooking. In cooking, there are so many different elements that can be found in cooking--the colors, the cultures, the tastes. Food can be an inspiration or a relaxant for her. Although eating the food is awesome, Julia absolutely enjoys the act of cooking. She turns her music up high and dances around the kitchen as she makes her creation. Julia wanted to construct this website to be able to share her recipes with the world, enabling others to feel the same joy she feels when she cooks. She would not have been able to make it happen without her wonderful experience at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> where she learned to code for the first time. Hope you enjoy Chow with the Gal!</font></div>
